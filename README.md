  Here's a project to showcase some of my skills. In terms of layout, I'll be using Rocketseat, but I've designed the project to be scalable, so I can add components, techniques, styles, and more to demonstrate my knowledge. Below, I'll include a section on "refactoring," highlighting the changes I've made to the original project or the tools I've added.
